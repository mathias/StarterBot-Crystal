# Welcome to your first Halite-II bot!
#
# This bot's name is CrystalClear. It's purpose is simple (don't expect it to win
# complex games :) ):
#  1. Initialize game
#  2. If a ship is not docked and there are unowned planets
#   a. Try to Dock in the planet if close enough
#   b. If not, go towards the planet

# Load the files we need
require "./hlt/*"
# require "game"

# GAME START

# Here we define the bot's name as Opportunity and initialize the game, including
# communication with the Halite engine.
game = Game.new("CrystalClear")
# We print our start message to the logs
game.logger.info("Starting my CrystalClear bot!")

  # end of the turn

        # We run this navigate command each turn until we arrive to get the
        # latest move.
        # Here we move at half our maximum speed to better control the ships
        # In order to execute faster we also choose to ignore ship collision
        # calculations during navigation.
        # This will mean that you have a higher probability of crashing into
        # ships, but it also means you will make move decisions much quicker.
        # As your skill progresses and your moves turn more optimal you may
        # wish to turn that option off.

        # many obstacles on the way or we are trapped (or we reached our
        # destination!), navigate_command will return null; don't fret though,
        # we can run the command again the next turn)
